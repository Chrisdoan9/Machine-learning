-Tensorflow: tensor + flow   
-Tensor is just a fancy word for a multi-dimensional array  
-Tensorflow is an end-to-end deep learning framework.  
A framework is like a toolbox that gives you everything you need to build and train machine learning models. So you can just focus on building the model, not creating everything from scratch.
